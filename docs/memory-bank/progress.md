# Progress

## Current Status

The Updraft frontend application has completed its migration to a **vertical slice architecture**. All features are now organized under `src/features/<feature>`, with each feature containing its own components, state, queries, types, assets, and tests. Vite and TypeScript aliases are fully aligned with this structure, supporting modular and intention-revealing imports.

## What Works

- Project setup and configuration
- Development environment with Vite
- TypeScript configuration
- Linting and formatting setup
- Initial documentation of Lit Signals best practices
- urql subscriptions/observables now used for GraphQL data fetching (replacing Task for these cases)
- **Vertical slice architecture is in place for all features**
- Vite/TS aliases support modular feature imports

## What's In Progress

- Implementation of core components following Lit Signals patterns **within the vertical slice structure**
- State management system setup (feature-based)
- Web3 connectivity integration
- UI component development (feature-based)

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Components**

   - Base component library
   - Layout components
   - Form components
   - Data display components

2. **Pages and Routes**

   - Home/landing page
   - Authentication flows
   - Dashboard
   - Profile pages
   - Project pages

3. **State Management**

   - User state (authentication, profile)
   - Application state
   - Data fetching and caching
   - Form state management

4. **Integration Points**

   - GraphQL API integration
   - Blockchain connectivity
   - SIWE authentication flow

5. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive layouts
   - Accessibility implementation
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

## Known Issues

- No significant issues identified yet as the project is in early stages
- Task is now reserved for smart contract reads and non-urql async operations; urql subscription pattern is preferred for GraphQL

## Next Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Core Architecture**

   - Complete the base component system
   - Implement state management patterns
   - Set up routing

2. **Milestone 2: Authentication Flow**

   - Implement wallet connection
   - Set up SIWE authentication
   - Create user profile management

3. **Milestone 3: Core Features**

   - Implement main application features
   - Build data visualization components
   - Complete API integrations

4. **Milestone 4: Polish & Performance**
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve UX
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Complete accessibility audit

## Required Decisions

Decisions needed to progress:

1. Specific UI component library usage strategy (custom vs. Shoelace)
2. Application state architecture details
3. Error handling and logging approach
4. Testing strategy and coverage requirements

## Technical Debt

Areas that may need refactoring or improvement:

1. Documentation completeness
2. Test coverage
3. Performance optimization

## Blockers

No significant blockers identified at this stage.
