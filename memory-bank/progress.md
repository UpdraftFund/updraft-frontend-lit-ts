# Progress

## Current Status

The Updraft frontend application is in the early development stages, with core architecture and patterns being established. Key documentation for Lit Signals best practices has been created to guide development.

## What Works

- Project setup and configuration
- Development environment with Vite
- TypeScript configuration
- Linting and formatting setup
- Initial documentation of Lit Signals best practices

## What's In Progress

- Implementation of core components following Lit Signals patterns
- State management system setup
- Web3 connectivity integration
- UI component development

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Components**

   - Base component library
   - Layout components
   - Form components
   - Data display components

2. **Pages and Routes**

   - Home/landing page
   - Authentication flows
   - Dashboard
   - Profile pages
   - Project pages

3. **State Management**

   - User state (authentication, profile)
   - Application state
   - Data fetching and caching
   - Form state management

4. **Integration Points**

   - GraphQL API integration
   - Blockchain connectivity
   - SIWE authentication flow

5. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive layouts
   - Accessibility implementation

   - Implement state management patterns
   - Set up routing

2. **Milestone 2: Authentication Flow**

   - Implement wallet connection
   - Set up SIWE authentication
   - Create user profile management

3. **Milestone 3: Core Features**

   - Implement main application features
   - Build data visualization components
   - Complete API integrations

4. **Milestone 4: Polish & Performance**
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve UX
   - Add animations and transitions
   - Complete accessibility audit

## Required Decisions

Decisions needed to progress:

1. Specific UI component library usage strategy (custom vs. Shoelace)
2. Application state architecture details
3. Error handling and logging approach
4. Testing strategy and coverage requirements

## Technical Debt

Areas that may need refactoring or improvement:

1. Documentation completeness
2. Test coverage
3. Performance optimization

## Blockers

No significant blockers identified at this stage.
